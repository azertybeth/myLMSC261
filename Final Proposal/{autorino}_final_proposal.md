How do you think you should be assessed?

----------------------------

For my project I wish to create a professional website for creative
commission work.
This project solves the issue of not having a tailor-made social media
platform that will allow me to not only host a portfolio, but also have
an embedded system for receiving new commission requests. Additionally,
making a website from scratch will allow me greater personalization
options, which can further attract an audience or better express my
creative processes.
Considering this is the "default" final project, I am anticipating
that Professor Rome will provide us with some resources; however, if
I find myself stuck, I expect to use the following sources with
citations depending on the efficacy of the solution:
Khan Academy, stackoverflow, YouTube, and Medium.
My audience for this project is primarily internet creators such as
VTubers, streamers, or other personalities that are not overtly musical
but will, in certain circumstances such as VODs (videos on demand), need
somebody who can treat, splice, and mix audio for their project.
I am uncertain of my timeline right now because I am not certain what
creating a website entails, however I wish to have my first draft
completed by the end of November.
I believe I should be assessed based on the following criteria:
Problem-solving/persistence, demonstrating utilization of concepts
learned in this course, and originality/creative ambition.
