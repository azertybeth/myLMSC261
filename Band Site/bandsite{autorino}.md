We started trying to add our individual bios and immediately realized that
we were writing over each other's code.
Rachel popped into our breakout room and suggested we work off of a template.
Once we established a template we were good to go.
Contribution was fairly equal; we each edited our own fictional "bio", and
discussed openly certain stylistic choices and ways to make our formatting
uniform. We had to coordinate pushing and pulling and merging branches so to
avoid un-doing anything.
Dom worked on getting an audio file into the website, and succeeded, though
he failed at achieving forced autoplay and looping.
I volunteered to embed a band photo into the page, and while I did download
an image and pushed it into the resource folder, I was unable to iron out
an error with it before time was up. The issue seemed to be a misplaced
resource, so I assume I just miscalled the img.
