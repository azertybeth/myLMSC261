Oi!

First I stole the line and spacing formatting from the column examples on
the course repository. Then I got a simple non-variable'd string to print with
my desired formatting. Last but not least, I created a simple variable meeting
the requirements of an equation that would equal 3, referenced the variable
in my print function, and included curly brackets and an f command.


Struggles:

* at first I didn't realize that the "\n" worked in unison in order to create
a line break. upon cursory examination it seemed that the slash was the only
character contributing to the line break, but after wrestling with comparing
my code with the example, I realized that I was only using half of a command.
After correcting my slashes to "\n", the line breaks worked as expected.
