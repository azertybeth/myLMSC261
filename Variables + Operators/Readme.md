Oi!

First I stole the line and spacing formatting from the column examples on
the course repository. Then I got a simple non-variable'd string to print with
my desired formatting. Last but not least, I created a simple variable meeting
the requirements of an equation that would equal 3, referenced the variable
in my print function, and included curly brackets and an f command.
