## Outline of Bloomberg's Article

  Section two of the article guides the reader to examine the aspects of computer
function that the general public would likely take for granted. The guiding
example used is the various processes used to do something as simple as
displaying a character on the screenâ€”something commonly thought of as a one-
step process.
  The article continues to detail the evolution of expectations and norms held
for software and hardware bundling and pricing formats, from whether or not
proprietary or third party software would come preinstalled with the purchase
of a personal computer, to initially-closed development ecosystems being opened
to third party develops (in the context of Apple's iOS sandbox).
